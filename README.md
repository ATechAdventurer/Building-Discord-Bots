# ATechAdventurer's Livestream #1 - Discord Bots

## Getting Started

To be able to follow along with the code I will be writing on stream you will need the following things installed:

Required:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime we use to build JS applications outside of the browser
- [A Discord Account](https://discordapp.com/) - Obviously 
- [A Discord Application]

Optional:
- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Visual Studio Code is my favorite IDE, its free and allows you to customize every aspect with themes, plugins and extensions.
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) - Nodemon is a tool that allows us to restart our NodeJS applications when it detects a project file has been saved
