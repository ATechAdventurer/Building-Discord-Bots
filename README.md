# ATechAdventurer's Livestream #1 - Discord Bots

## Getting Started

To be able to follow along with the code I will be writing on stream you will need the following things installed:

Required:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime we use to build JS applications outside of the browser
- [A Discord Account](https://discordapp.com/) - Obviously 
- [A Discord Application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) - See [this guide](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia/wiki/Setting-up-a-Discord-application)

Recomended (Optional):
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.
- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Visual Studio Code is my favorite IDE, its free and allows you to customize every aspect with themes, plugins and extensions.
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) - Nodemon is a tool that allows us to restart our NodeJS applications when it detects a project file has been saved
